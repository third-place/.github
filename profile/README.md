# Welcome to Third Place

Third place is an open source social network. The code that powers this site is free for anyone to download, view, and modify. We embrace open source because that is how we learned to program, and we hope others find this project useful in their learning journey.

While Third place is in closed beta, invite codes are required for signing up.

See it [live here](https://thirdplaceapp.com/).

We have a [Backstage](https://backstage.io/) deployment [here](https://backstage.thirdplaceapp.com/).
